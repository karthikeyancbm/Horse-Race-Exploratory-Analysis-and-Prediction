# Horse-Race-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Prediction
# Problem statement:
This project aims to predict horse racing outcomes using machine learning techniques. Given the complexity and inherent unpredictability of horse racing, this project seeks to explore various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

# Project goals:

**Primary goal** : To predict the outcome of horse races (e.g., win or place).

**Secondary goals**:

 * To identify significant features affecting race outcomes.
 * To do Exploratory analysis
 * To explore the imbalanced nature of the dataset and develop techniques to handle it.
 * To create a robust prediction model using historical data.       

# Data Preprocessing:

**Data Cleaning**:
   * Handle missing values.
   * Normalize data where necessary (e.g., times, distances)
   * Convert categorical variables to numerical representations
            
# Feature Engineering:
  * Create new features based on existing data
  * Aggregate features across multiple races to capture trends
        
# Data Integration:
  * Merge race and horse datasets on rid to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
**Descriptive Statistics:**
  * Summary statistics of key features
  * Distribution plots of continuous variables.
    
**Correlation Analysis:**
  * Correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
    
**Visualization:**
  * Bar plots, histograms, and box plots to visualize data distribution
  * Heatmaps for correlation visualization.
